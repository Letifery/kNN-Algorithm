# kNN-Algorithm-v1.0.0

Just my implementation of the kNN-Algorithm. The task was to implement said algorithm to automatically detect and translate 16x16 numerical images to their corresponding values, plot the runtime/accuracy of the algorithm with respect to the used k hyperparameter and to make it somewhat efficient.

If you (or future me) wants to try the code out: 

Download the training/test ZIP-code dataset from https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/data.html, change the corresponding path and you are ready to go :) Just look at the driver code at the end and you will understand how to use this program
