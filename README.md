# kNN-Algorithm-v1.1.0

My implementation of the kNN-Algorithm for my machine-leaning course. It currently supports the use of cross-validation and running the algorithm for multiple k's at once with reduced runtime. This implementation also plots the accuracy in respekt to k (if you used multiple k's at once, obviously), shows the wrong numbers and a lot more information, if you use the cross-validation class.
